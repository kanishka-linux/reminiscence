# Installation

1. First make sure that **python 3.5.2+** (recommended version is 3.6.5+) is installed on system and install following packages using native package manager.

        1. virtualenv
    
        2. wkhtmltopdf (for html to pdf/png conversion)
    
        3. redis-server (optional)

        4. chromium (optional from v0.2+)
    
2. Installation of above dependencies in Arch or Arch based distros

        $ sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv wkhtmltopdf redis chromium
    
3. Installation of above dependencies in Debian or Ubuntu based distros

        $ sudo apt install virtualenv wkhtmltopdf redis-server chromium-browser
        
4. Installation of above dependencies in Windows        
   
        First Install virtualenv using pip(pip3)
        $ pip install virtualenv
        
        You can install other applications using scoop (or chocolatey/winget but I prefer scoop) or from their official website
        
        To Install Using scoop
        $ scoop install wkhtmltopdf chromium redis5
        
        If you get error while installing chromium (its because `chromium` isn't in the main bucket so you'll have to add the extra bucket if you hadn't), do this 
        $ scoop bucket add extras 
        $ scoop install chromium
        
        To install manually grab the installer from Github and install them
        
        Wkhtmltopdf - https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases
        Chromium    - https://github.com/macchrome/winchrome/releases
        Redis       - https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases 

**Note:** Name of above dependencies may change depending on distro or OS, so install accordingly. Once above dependencies are installed, execute following commands, which are distro/platform independent. 
    
#### Now execute following commands in terminal.

    $ mkdir reminiscence
    
    $ cd reminiscence
    
    $ virtualenv -p python3 venv 
    
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (On Windows, run `.\venv\Scripts\activate`)
    
    $ cd venv
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence.git
    
    $ cd reminiscence
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    **Note:** you may get a error while Pyscopg2 will be installing (tested and encountered it On Windows and Ubuntu 20.04) of configuring a `pg_config` (see this [issue](https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence/issues/57)). Edit 20th Line in `requirements.txt` file i.e. `psycopg2==2.7.5` to `psycopg2-binary` and run the above command again to fix the error
    
    $ mkdir logs archive tmp
    
    $ python manage.py generatesecretkey
    
    $ python manage.py nltkdownload
    
    $ python manage.py migrate
    
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

    $ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 
    
    open 127.0.0.1:8000 using any browser, login and start adding links
    
    **Note:** replace localhost address with local ip address of your server
            
              to access web-interface from anywhere on the local network

    Admin interface available at: /admin/
              

#### Setting up Celery (optional):

1. Generating PDFs and PNGs are resource intesive and time consuming. We can delegate these tasks to celery, in order to execute them in the background. 
    
        Edit reminiscence/settings.py file and set USE_CELERY = True
    
2. Now open another terminal in the same topmost project directory and execute following commands:
    
        $ cd venv
    
        $ source bin/activate
        (On Windows, run `.\Scripts\activate`)
    
        $ cd venv/reminiscence
    
        $ celery -A reminiscence worker --loglevel=info
    
3. launch redis-server from another terminal
    
        $ redis-server
        
## Using Docker

Using docker is convenient compared to normal installation method described above. It will take care of configuration and setting up of gunicorn, nginx and also postgresql database. (Setting and running up these three things can be a bit cumbersome, if done manually, which is described below in separate section.) It will also automatically download headless version of wkhtmltopdf from official github repository (Since, many distros do not package wkhtmltopdf with headless feature) and nltk data set, apart from installing python based dependencies.

1. Install docker and docker-compose

2. Enable/start docker service. Instructions for enabling docker might be different in different distros. Sample instruction for enabling/starting docker will look like

        $ systemctl enable/start docker.service

3. clone github repository and enter directory

        $ git clone https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence.git

        $ cd reminiscence

4. build and start

        $ sudo docker-compose up --build

        Note: Above instruction will take some time when executed for the first time.

5. Above step will also create default user: 'admin' with default password: 'changepassword'

6. If IP address of server is '**192.168.1.2**' then admin interface will be available at 

        192.168.1.2/admin/

        Note: In this method, there is no need to
              attach port number to IP address.

7. Change default admin password from admin interface and create new regular user. After that logout, and open '**192.168.1.2**'. Now login with regular user for regular activity.

8. For custom configuration, modify nginx.conf and dockerfiles available in the repository. After that execute step 4 again.

**Note:** If Windows users are facing problem in mounting data volume for Postgres, they are advised to refer this [issue](https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence/issues/1).

**Note:** Ubuntu 16.04 users might have to modify docker-compose.yml file and need to change version 3 to 2. [issue](https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence/issues/4)

**Note:** For setting celery inside docker follow [these instruction](https://github.com/kanishka-linux/reminiscence/wiki/Celery-Plus-Docker). Sometimes gunicorn doesn't work properly with default background task handler inside docker. In such cases users can enable celery.

# Documentation

## Adding Directories And Links

* **Creating Directory**

    Users first have to create directory from web interface.

    **Note:** Currently '/' and few other special characters are not allowed as characters in directory name. If users are facing problem when accessing directory, then they are advised to rename directory and remove special characters.

    ![reminiscence](/Images/default.png)
    
* **Adding Links**

    Users have to navigate to required directory and then need to add links to it. URLs are fetched asynchronously from the source for gathering metadata initially. Users have to wait for few seconds, after that page will refresh automatically showing new content. It may happen, nothing would show up after automatic page refresh (e.g. due to slow URL fetching) then try refreshing page manually by clicking on directory entry again. Maybe in future, I will have to look into django channels and websockets to enable real-time duplex communication between client and server.

## Automatic Tagging and Summarization

This feature has been implemented using NLTK library. The library has been used for proper tokenization and removing stopwords from sentence. Once stopwords are removed, top K high frequency words (where value of K is decided by user) are used as tags. In order to generate summary of HTML content, score is alloted to a sentence based on frequency of non-stopwords contained in it. After that highests score sentences (forming 1/3'rd of total content) are used to generate summary. It is one of the simplest methods for automatic tagging and summarization, hence not perfect. It can't tag group of meaningful words. e.g. It will not consider 'data structure' as a single tag. Supporting multi-word tags is in TODO list of the project.

About summarization, there are many advance methods which may give even more better results, which users can find in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02268.pdf). Both these feature needs to be activated from **Settings** box. It is off by default.

![reminiscence](/Images/settings.png)

## Reader mode

Once user will open link using inbuilt reader, the application will try to present text content, properly formatted for mobile devices whenever possible. In reader mode user will also find options **Original, PDF and PNG**, at the top header. These options will be available only when user has archived the link in those formats. Options for selecting archive file format is available in every user's **Settings** box.  If **Original**, format is selected then users can see the text content along with original stylesheet and linked images. Javascript will be removed from original file format due to security reasons. If page can't be displayed due to lack of javascript then users have to depend on either PDF or full-page PNG formats.

![reminiscence](/Images/reader.png)

## Generating PDF and PNG

PDF and full-page screenshot in PNG format of HTML page will be generated using wkhtmltopdf. It is headless tool but in some distro it might not be packaged with headless feature. In such cases, users have to run it using Xvfb. In order to use it headlessly using Xvfb, set **USE_XVFB = True** in reminiscence/settings.py file and then install xvfb using command line.

**Note:** Use Xvfb, only when wkhtmltopdf is not packaged with headless feature.

**Note:** Alternatively Users can also download official headless wkhtmltopdf for their resepctive distro/OS from [here](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases). Only problem is that, users will have to update the package manually on their own for every new update.

**Why not use Headless Chromium?** 

Currently headless chromium doesn't support full page screenshot, otherwise I might have used it blindly. There is another headless browser [hlspy](https://github.com/kanishka-linux/hlspy), based on QtWebEngine, which I built for my personal use. **hlspy** can generate entire html content, pdf document and full page screenshot in one single request and that too using just one single process. In both chromium and wkhtmltopdf, one has to execute atleast two separate processes for doing the same thing. The main problem with hlspy is that it is not completely headless, it can't run without X. It requires xvfb for running in headless environment. 

In future, I'll try to provide a way to choose between different backends (i.e. chromium, wkhtmltopdf or hlspy) for performing these tasks.

**Note:** From v0.2+ onwards, support for headless Chromium has been added for generating HTML and PDF content. Users can use this feature if default archived content has some discrepancies. Users need to install Chromium to use this feature.

## Archiving Media Elements

**Note:** This feature is available from v0.2+ onwards

1. In settings.py file add your favourite download manager to DOWNLOAD_MANAGERS_ALLOWED list. Default are curl and wget. In case of docker based method users have to make corresponding changes in dockersettings.py file. For large arbitrary files with direct download links, curl and wget are good enough. For complex use cases users will need something like youtube-dl, which they have to install and manage on their own and needs to be added to the DOWNLOAD_MANAGERS_ALLOWED list.  

2. open web-interface settings box and add command to Download Manager Field:
    
        ex: wget {iurl} -O {output}
    
        iurl -> input url
        output -> output path

        OR

        ex: youtube-dl {iurl} -o {output}
    
3. Users should not substitute anything for {iurl} and {output} field, they should be kept as it is. In short, users should just write regular command with parameters and leave the {iurl} and {output} field untouched. (Note: do not even remove curly brackets).
    
4. Reminiscence server will take care of setting up of input url i.e. {iurl} and output path field i.e. {output}. 
    
5. If user is using youtube-dl as a download manager, then it is advisable to install ffmpeg along with it. In this case user has to take care of regular updating of youtube-dl on their own. In docker based installation, users have to add installation instructions for ffmpeg in Dockerfile; and then need to modify requirements.txt and add youtube_dl as dependency.

6. Web-interface settings box also contains, streaming option. If this option is enabled, then HTML5 compliant media files can be played inside browsers, otherwise they will be available for download on the client machine.

7. If users are upgrading from older version then they are advised to apply database migration using following commands, before using new features:

        python manage.py makemigrations

        python manage.py migrate

8. Finally, when adding url to any directory just prepend **md:** to url, so that the particular entry will be recognized by custom download manager.

        ex=> md:https://some-website-with-media-link.org/media-link

        Every entry added by this way will be treated as containing media

        or single arbitrary file with direct download link.

9. Archived files are normally saved in **archive** folder. Users can change location of this folder via settings.py file. Users should note that in order to archive media files, the **archive** location should not contain any space.
e.g. archive location '/home/user/my downloads/archive' is not allowed. However location without space '/home/user/my_downloads/archive' is allowed.

10. By default, archived media links are not shared with anyone. However, users can create public links for some fixed time. Once a public link has been created, it will remain valid for 24 hours. Users can change this value by changing value of VIDEO_ID_EXPIRY_LIMIT in settings.py. These public links are also useful for playing non-HTML5 compliant archived media on regular media players like mpv/mplayer/vlc etc..It is also possible to generate a playlist in m3u format for a directory containing media links, which can be played by any popular media player.

## Annotation And Read-it-later Feature

This is the latest feature and available from v0.3+ onwards. This feature allows addition, deletion and modification of annotation.

* Users can annotate archived HTML page, its readable version and also pdf version.

* Users can also annotate archived or uploaded pdf/epub files.

* The application will remember last read position of html, pdf and epub.

Annotation support works well on desktop browsers. On mobile, this feature works mostly on firefox (for annotating html/pdf/epub).

#### How to use this feature on desktop browsers?

* Higlight text -> an annotation balloon will popup -> click on it -> add/save comment.

* Click on the `back` button, at the bottom right corner to save last read position and go back to previous page.

#### How to use this feature on mobile firefox?

* `Double tap` on starting word from where you want to highlight -> Selection markers will appear (and annotation balloon too but don't tap on it) -> Drag the end of selection marker to the desired end point -> now `single tap` at the last word -> an annotation balloon will popup -> tap on the balloon -> add/save comment.

* Click on the `back` button, at the bottom right corner to save last read position and go back to previous page.

How these featues have been implemented?

* for annotation [annotator.js](http://annotatorjs.org/) has been used at the client side.

* PDFs are displayed using [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) within browser, on which annotation layer is applied using `annotator.js`.

* EPUBs are displayed using [epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/) within browser, on which annotation layer is applied using `annotator.js`

* annotation data for each file and the last read position is saved at the backend.

## REST API

Reminiscence uses Django Rest Framework for exposing few functionalities via REST endpoints (available from v0.3+ onwards).

Following are few examples of API usage using cURL

1. Login and get auth token (POST) `/restapi/login/`

        $ curl -d username=mypy -d password=foobarbaz http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/login/

Token obtained with above request needs to be passed to every subsequent request header. We'll call the token as **AUTHTOKEN** for rest of the examples.

2. Add url to Reminiscence instance in a specific directory (POST) `/restapi/add-url/`

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Token AUTHTOKEN" -d url="https://mr.wikipedia.org" -d media_link=no -d directory="/Wiki/Marathi" http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/add-url/

3. List all urls added to a specific directory (POST) `/restapi/list-added-urls/`

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Token AUTHTOKEN" -d directory="/Wiki" http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/list-added-urls/

4. List all directories (GET) `/restapi/list-directories/`

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Token AUTHTOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/list-directories/

5. Logout and remove token (GET) `/restapi/logout/`

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Token AUTHTOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8000/restapi/logout/

## Running Tests

* When running all tests exlude async tests. Async tests need to run separately.

        $ python manage.py test --exclude-tag=async

* Only **tests_drf.py** file contains async test, so run it separately.

        $ python manage.py test tests.tests_drf
        
## Note Taking

From v0.3 onwards, users can add arbitrary note to their collection. Support for note taking is rudimentary and provides note taking using simple WYSIWYG editor.

For adding note use following command in the input url box:

        note:New note

        above command will create *New note* in the current folder

        
## Public-Private-Group directories

By default, all directories and all links are private and are not shared with anyone. However, users can select one public directory and one group directory from all available directories for sharing links. User can set public and group directory via settings. Links placed in public directory will be available for public viewing and links placed in group directory will be available for pre-determined list of users selected by account holder.

Public links of a user can be accesed at the url: 

        /username/profile/public

Group links of a user can be accesed by pre-determined group of users at the url: 

        /username/profile/group

## Searching Bookmarks

Bookmarks can be searched according to title, url, tag or summary by using search menu available at the top most navigation bar. By default bookmarks will be searched according to **title**. In order to search according to url, tag or summary, users have to prefix **url:**, **tag:**, or **sum:** to the search term, in the search box.

Note: Special search prefix **tag-wall:** will display all available tags.


## About Database

By default, reminiscence uses sqlite database, but users can replace it with any database supported by django ORM like postgresql. Some simple instructions for using postgresql with django are available [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04) . Users can also take a look at this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL), for proper postgresql database setup. There might be some changes in the instructions depending on the OS and distributions you are using.

## Understanding Settings Files

reminiscence folder contains three settings files 

    1. settings.py

    2. defaultsettings.py

    3. dockersettings.py

* In normal installation procedure, settings.py file is used. If user will make changes in it then those changes will be reflected in normal installation method. 

* In docker based method dockersettings.py file is used. Settings of this file will be copied during docker installation method.

* defaultsettings.py is the backup file. If user has somehow corrupted settings files while manually editing, then original settings can be restored using this file.

## Gunicorn plus Nginx setup

**(optional)**

* Install gunicorn, if not installed. (pip install gunicorn)

* Instead of using **python manage.py runserver** command as mentioned in above installation instructions use following command. Users can change parameters according to need. Only make sure to keep value of **timeout** argument somewhat bigger. Larger timeout value is useful, if upload speed is slow and user want to upload relatively large body from web-interface.

        $ gunicorn --max-requests 100 --worker-class gthread --workers 2 --thread 5 --timeout 300 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 reminiscence.wsgi

* Install **nginx** using native package manager of distro and then make adjustments to nginx config files as given below. Following is sample configuration. Adjust it according to need, but pay special attention to **proxy_read_timeout** and **client_max_body_size** variables. Incorrect value of these two variables can make upload from web-interface impractical.

            worker_processes  2;
        
            events {
                worker_connections  1024;
            }
        
        
            http {
                include       mime.types;
                default_type  application/octet-stream;
            
                sendfile        on;
                sendfile_max_chunk 512k;
                keepalive_timeout  65;
                proxy_read_timeout 300s;
            
                server {
                listen       80;
                server_name  localhost;
                client_max_body_size 1024m;
                  
                location /static/ {
                        root /home/reminiscence/venv/reminiscence; # root of project directory
                        aio threads;
                    }
                location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
                location / {
                    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                    root /home/reminiscence/venv/reminiscence; #root of project directory
                }
        
                
                error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
                location = /50x.html {
                    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                }
                }
            }


* Once nginx config file is properly configured, start/enable nginx.service. For detailed instructions take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04) or refer this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nginx). There are some barebone instructions available [here](http://gunicorn.org/index.html#deployment), which users might find useful.

* When using gunicorn as web server and nginx as reverse proxy, it is necessary to add static files of admin interface to the **static** folder. Otherwise, admin interface won't render properly. Users can do it manually. Or alternatively, they can modify setting.py file and add 
    
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")
    
to it. After that collect staticfiles using command

        $ python manage.py collectstatic
        
Once staticfiles of admin have been collected in the **static** folder, users should remove **STATIC_ROOT** from settings.py, before running the web server.

# Motivation

Till few years back, I used to think that once something has been published on the web, it is going to remain there forever in some form or other. But web of today is different. Now we never know, when some valuable web resource (like web-pages, images, text, pdf etc...) will disappear from the web completely. There might be variety of reasons for disappearance (e.g. author of resource lost interest in maintaining it, low traffic or some other political-economic reasons). I don't want to go into details, but there are plenty of reasons due to which web-resource that we savoured in the past, might become un-available in the future. If we are lucky, then we may find mirrors of popular sites of the past, archived by volunteers. But, the same can't be said true of obscure and rare web content. So, I decided to develop Reminiscence for saving personal memories of the web effectively and in a well organized manner, which somehow turned into a hybrid of bookmark manager and personal wayback machine.
